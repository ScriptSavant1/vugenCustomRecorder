## Overview: Two Tools, One Workflow

This toolset has two tools. Most users will use both:

```
┌──────────────────────┐       ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      │       │                                          │

     Step 1                              Step 2
```

**If you just want to explore:** Tool 1 alone generates a working script.
**If you want a production-quality script:** Use Tool 2 after Tool 1.

---

# PART A — TOOL 1: VuGen-Recorder.html

## A1. Before You Start

**You will need:**
- [ ] The file `VuGen-Recorder.html` (from your LRE admin team)
- [ ] Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Firefox
- [ ] Access to the application you want to test
- [ ] A list of the transactions you want to measure (see below)

**What is a transaction?**
A transaction is one logical step your user takes — something you want to measure separately.

**Example — Online shopping site:**

| Transaction Name | User action |
|---|---|
| `T01_Homepage` | Open the website |
| `T02_Login` | Enter credentials and sign in |
| `T03_Search` | Search for a product |
| `T04_AddToCart` | Add an item to the cart |
| `T05_Checkout` | Complete the purchase |

**Transaction naming rules:**
```
✅ Correct:    T01_Login        T02_Search       T03_Add_To_Cart
❌ Wrong:      T01 Login        (no spaces)
❌ Wrong:      01_Login         (must start with a letter)
❌ Wrong:      T01-Login        (no hyphens — use underscores)
❌ Wrong:      T01_Login!!      (no special characters)
```

## A2. One-Time Setup — Add the Bookmarklets to Your Browser

> You only need to do this once. After this, the bookmarklets stay in your browser permanently.

**What are bookmarklets?** They are two special bookmarks that silently mark the start and end of each transaction while you record — without taking you away from your application page.

### Step 1 — Show Your Browser's Bookmarks Bar

The Bookmarks Bar is the row of saved links just below the address bar.

- **Chrome or Edge:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + B`
- **Firefox:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + B`

The bar will appear. If you already have bookmarks, you will see them there.

---

### Step 2 — Open VuGen-Recorder.html and Drag the Bookmarklets

1. Open `VuGen-Recorder.html` in your browser (double-click the file)
2. You will see a green box at the top labelled **"Set Up Bookmarklets"**
3. Inside it are two buttons:
   - A green **▶ START Transaction** button
   - A red **■ END Transaction** button
4. **Drag each button** from the page onto your Bookmarks Bar

```
   Bookmarks Bar (just below the address bar):
   ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  ▶ START Transaction   ■ END Transaction   [other bookmarks]  │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
            ↑                       ↑
       Drag here               Drag here
       from the green box in the tool
```

5. Both bookmarks now appear in your Bookmarks Bar — setup complete.

> **If dragging doesn't work:** Right-click each button in the tool → select **"Bookmark this link"** → choose **Bookmarks Bar** as the folder → click Save.

---

## A3. Recording Your Application

### Step 3 — Open Developer Tools (F12)

1. Open your browser (Chrome or Edge recommended)
2. Navigate to your application's starting page
3. Press **F12** on your keyboard — a panel will open at the bottom or side of the screen
4. Click the **"Network"** tab inside that panel
5. Click the **🚫 (Clear)** button to remove any old entries
6. Confirm the **red record circle ⏺** is active

> **Important:** Keep Developer Tools open for the entire recording. Do not close it.

---

### Step 4 — Record Your Transactions

Repeat these three steps for each transaction:

**a) Mark the START of the transaction**
1. Click the **▶ START Transaction** bookmark in your Bookmarks Bar
2. A small popup appears — type your transaction name (e.g. `T01_Login`) and click **OK**
3. You stay on your current page — the marker fires silently in the background

**b) Perform the transaction steps**
- Click links and buttons in your application
- Fill in forms, submit them, wait for pages to load
- Use the application exactly as a real user would

**c) Mark the END of the transaction**
1. Click the **■ END Transaction** bookmark
2. Type the **same name** you used for START (e.g. `T01_Login`) → click **OK**
3. Immediately click **▶ START Transaction** for your next transaction

**Example of what you will see in the Network tab:**
```
  START-T01_Login.invalid     ← Marker (status: failed — this is correct)
  GET   /login          200
  POST  /authenticate   200
  GET   /dashboard      200
  END-T01_Login.invalid       ← Marker (status: failed — this is correct)
  START-T02_Search.invalid    ← Marker
  GET   /search?q=...   200
  END-T02_Search.invalid      ← Marker
```

> The `.invalid` markers show as "failed" in the Network tab — **this is intentional and correct**.

---

### Step 5 — Save the HAR File

After completing all transactions:

1. In the Network tab, **right-click** on any request row
2. Click **"Save all as HAR with content"**
3. A Save dialog appears — choose a folder (Desktop or Downloads)
4. Name the file something meaningful: e.g., `MyApp_Recording_1.har`
5. Click **Save**

> **Firefox users:** Click the download arrow icon (⬇) in the Network tab toolbar → "Save All As HAR"

---

## A4. Generating Your Script

### Step 6 — Load the HAR File into the Tool

1. Open `VuGen-Recorder.html` in your browser
2. **Drag and drop** your `.har` file onto the grey drop area
   — OR click the **"Browse HAR File"** button and find the file
3. A dialog appears asking which script format you want:

| Format | Choose this if... |
|---|---|
| **Web HTTP/HTML** | Your LRE project uses Web HTTP/HTML protocol |
| **DevWeb** | Your LRE project uses DevWeb protocol |
| **Both** | You want both formats generated at once |

4. Select the format and click **OK**

The tool will instantly:
- Detect your transaction markers
- Filter out noise (images, fonts, analytics trackers)
- Generate your script(s)

---

### Step 7 — Review and Download

**Review the table:** You will see your requests grouped into colour-coded transaction bands. Check that the groupings look correct.

**Collapse/expand transactions:** If you have many transactions, click any transaction header row (the coloured ▼ START row) to collapse that group. Use the **"⊖ Collapse All"** button in the toolbar to minimise everything at once, then expand just the transactions you want to inspect.

**Adjust filters if needed:**
- The left panel shows domains — uncheck any you do not want in the script
- The top checkboxes filter static assets, analytics, and pre-flight requests
- The script preview updates live as you change filters

> **Note:** Some requests are always excluded automatically: browser pre-flights (OPTIONS), analytics trackers, CSP violation reports, and WebSocket connections (`wss://`). These cannot be replayed by VuGen and would cause errors if included.

**Download your script:**
Click **"⬇ Download Script"** → a ZIP file downloads containing your complete VuGen project.

---

### Step 8 — Copy to Your LRE Project

**Unzip the downloaded file.** It contains:

| File | Protocol | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Action.c` | Web HTTP/HTML | Main script with all requests and transactions |
| `vuser_init.c` | Web HTTP/HTML | Initialization (runs once at start) |
| `vuser_end.c` | Web HTTP/HTML | Cleanup (runs once at end) |
| `globals.h` | Web HTTP/HTML | Required header file |
| `default.cfg` | Web HTTP/HTML | Runtime settings |
| `ScriptUploadMetadata.xml` | Web HTTP/HTML | Required project metadata |
| `main.js` | DevWeb | Complete DevWeb script |

Copy all files into your VuGen/LRE project folder. Ask your LRE admin if you are unsure where that is.

# PART B — TOOL 2: VuGen-Script-Studio.html

## Why Use Tool 2?

A basic recording captures the exact values that were used during your recording session — for example, your session ID, CSRF token, and hidden form fields. These values change with every new session. If you run the basic script under load, every virtual user will fail because they will all try to use the same session ID from your recording.

**Tool 2 solves this** by comparing two recordings and automatically detecting every value that changes between sessions. It then generates `web_reg_save_param` rules to extract those values dynamically at runtime.

---

## B1. Record a Second HAR File

You need to record the **same user journey twice**. Each recording must be a completely separate browser session (log out fully, then log in again as a fresh user).

**Recording 1:** Already done in Part A — this is your `MyApp_Recording_1.har`

**Recording 2:**
1. Close your browser completely (or open a fresh Incognito window: `Ctrl+Shift+N`)
2. Repeat the exact same steps as Recording 1:
   - Press F12 → Network tab → Clear entries
   - Click ▶ START for each transaction → do the steps → click ■ END
   - Save as HAR → name it `MyApp_Recording_2.har`

> **Important:** Perform exactly the same actions in both recordings. The tool compares them step by step.

---

## B2. Open VuGen-Script-Studio.html

1. Double-click `VuGen-Script-Studio.html` to open it in your browser
2. You will see the upload area with two drop zones

---

## B3. Load Your HAR Files

**With two HAR files (recommended):**
1. Drag `MyApp_Recording_1.har` onto the **left drop zone** (labelled "HAR Recording 1")
2. Drag `MyApp_Recording_2.har` onto the **right drop zone** (labelled "HAR Recording 2")
3. Click **"Generate Script"**

**With one HAR file only:**
1. Drag your HAR file onto the **left drop zone** only
2. Click **"Generate Script"**
   (The tool will still detect common patterns like JWT tokens, CSRF headers, and session cookies)

---

## B4. What the Tool Does Automatically

While processing, the tool performs several steps automatically:

```
1. Match requests    → Pairs up each request in Recording 1 with its
                       equivalent in Recording 2 (same URL + method)

2. Detect changes    → Finds every value that is different between the
                       two sessions (session IDs, tokens, form fields)

3. Back-trace source → For each changed value, finds which earlier
                       response contains it (response body, header, cookie)

4. Generate rules    → Creates web_reg_save_param() extraction rules
                       and places them in the correct position in the script

5. Parameterise      → Detects common user data fields (username, password,
                       card number, dates) and replaces them with parameters

6. Build project     → Assembles a complete, ready-to-use VuGen project ZIP
```

---

## B5. Review the Results

After processing, you will see:

**Script preview tabs:**
- **Action.c** — Web HTTP/HTML script with all correlations and parameters
- **main.js** — DevWeb script with all correlations and parameters
- **ParameterFile.prm** — Parameter file listing all detected data parameters
- **collection_data.dat** / **collection_data.csv** — Data files with your recorded values

**Correlations panel (right side):** Lists every dynamic value that was detected and correlated. For each one, it shows:
- The parameter name (e.g. `JSessionId`, `SourcePage`, `AuthToken`)
- The extraction type (from response body, response header, or cookie)
- Where it is used in the script

**Parameters panel:** Lists data values that were detected and made into parameters (e.g. `Username`, `Password`, `CardNumber`).

---

## B6. Download the Script

Click **"⬇ Download ZIP"** — a complete VuGen project archive downloads.

**What is inside the ZIP:**

For **Web HTTP/HTML:**
```
Action.c                  ← Main script with correlations and parameterisation
vuser_init.c              ← Initialization file
vuser_end.c               ← Cleanup file
globals.h                 ← Required header
default.cfg               ← Runtime settings
ScriptUploadMetadata.xml  ← Project metadata
ParameterFile.prm         ← Parameter definitions (username, password, etc.)
collection_data.dat       ← Data rows (one per virtual user iteration)
```

For **DevWeb:**
```
main.js                   ← Complete DevWeb script
parameters.yml            ← Parameter definitions
collection_data.csv       ← Data rows
rts.yml                   ← Runtime settings
tsconfig.json             ← TypeScript config
DevWebSdk.d.ts            ← SDK type definitions
```

---

## B7. Copy to Your LRE Project

Unzip the downloaded file and copy all files into your LRE project folder. For Web HTTP/HTML, copy into your existing VuGen project folder (replacing existing files). Ask your LRE admin if you need help.

---

# PART C — COMMON QUESTIONS

## Can I use Tool 2 without Tool 1?

Yes. VuGen-Script-Studio.html is completely independent. You can record HAR files directly using browser DevTools (F12) without going through VuGen-Recorder.html first.

## What format should I choose?

Ask your LRE admin. If you are unsure:
- **Web HTTP/HTML** — the more established format, used in most existing LRE environments
- **DevWeb** — newer format, preferred for modern web applications

## What if my username and password are hardcoded in the script?

Tool 2 automatically detects username and password fields and replaces them with `{Username}` and `{Password}` parameters. You then add your test user credentials to the `collection_data.dat` file (one row per virtual user).

## What if the tool shows "unresolved candidates"?

Some dynamic values could not be automatically traced to their source. These appear as `// TODO` comment blocks in the generated script — **no broken code is emitted**, just a note explaining which values need manual attention and where they are used. Your LRE admin can resolve these by re-recording with **"Disable cache"** enabled in DevTools (⚙ → Disable cache), or by adding the extraction rule manually in VuGen's Correlation Studio.
